# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if having "development" and "production" environments, Pipfile.lock is included in
#   ".gitignore" to avoid issues with deployments

#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
